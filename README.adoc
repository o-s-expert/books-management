Sample Helidon MP project that includes multiple REST operations. This project requires Oracle NoSQL for data storage, which can be run locally or online.

== Requirements

This application requires Oracle NoSQL Database, which can be set up to run locally using Docker.

== Setting up Oracle NoSQL Locally with Docker

To run Oracle NoSQL Database locally, use the following Docker command:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -d --name oracle-instance -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/oracle/nosql:latest-ce
----

This command starts an Oracle NoSQL instance running on port `8080` of your local machine.

Alternatively, you may run Oracle NoSQL Database online. For more details, refer to Oracle's official documentation on running NoSQL in the cloud.

== Build and run

To build and run this project, use JDK 21.

[source,bash]
----
mvn package
java -jar target/movies.jar
----

The application will start on `localhost` at port `8181`.

== Try Health Check

To verify if the application is running, check its health status with:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -X GET http://localhost:8181/health
----
Expected Output:
`{"outcome":"UP",...}`

== Try Metrics

You can retrieve application metrics in Prometheus or JSON format.

=== Prometheus Format

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -X GET http://localhost:8181/metrics
----
Expected Output:
`# TYPE base:gc_g1_young_generation_count gauge...`

=== JSON Format

[source,bash]
----
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -X GET http://localhost:8181/metrics
----
Expected Output:
`{"base":...}`

== OpenAPI UI

This project includes an OpenAPI UI, which provides an interactive interface for exploring and testing API endpoints.

To access the OpenAPI UI, navigate to the following URL in your browser:

http://localhost:8181/openapi/ui/index.html#

The OpenAPI UI displays all available API endpoints and allows you to test requests directly within the browser.

== Using the OpenAPI Endpoints with curl

Below are examples of using `curl` to interact with the API.

[source,bash]
----
# Example: Fetch all movies
curl -X GET http://localhost:8181/movies

# Example: Add a new movie
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Inception", "genre": "SCIENCE_FICTION", "releaseYear": 2010, "director": "Christopher Nolan", "actors": ["Leonardo DiCaprio", "Joseph Gordon-Levitt"]}' http://localhost:8181/movies

# Example: Update a movie
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Inception", "genre": "SCIENCE_FICTION", "releaseYear": 2010, "director": "Christopher Nolan", "actors": ["Leonardo DiCaprio", "Joseph Gordon-Levitt"]}' http://localhost:8181/movies/{id}

# Example: Delete a movie
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8181/movies/{id}
----

== Building the Docker Image

To build a Docker image for the application:

[source,bash]
----
docker build -t movies .
----

== Running the Docker Image

To run the Docker image:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm -p 8181:8181 movies:latest
----

== Run the Application in Kubernetes

If you donâ€™t have access to a Kubernetes cluster, you can https://helidon.io/docs/latest/#/about/kubernetes[install one] on your desktop.

=== Verify connectivity to cluster

[source,bash]
----
kubectl cluster-info                        # Verify which cluster
kubectl get pods                            # Verify connectivity to cluster
----

=== Deploy the application to Kubernetes

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create -f app.yaml                              # Deploy application
kubectl get pods                                        # Wait for quickstart pod to be RUNNING
kubectl get service movies                              # Get service info
kubectl port-forward service/movies 8181:8080           # Forward service port to 8181
----

You can now exercise the application as described above but use port `8181`.

After you're done, clean up:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete -f app.yaml
----
